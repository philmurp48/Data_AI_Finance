## 📝 **Tone Guidelines**

### **1. Professional & Trustworthy**

**Principle:** Financial data demands precision and confidence

**How to Apply:**
- Use authoritative yet approachable language
- Employ precise financial terminology
- Maintain structured, professional formatting
- Convey reliability through clear communication

**Examples:**
```
✅ Good: "Transaction processing with 3-tier approval workflow"
❌ Avoid: "Easy transaction stuff with approvals"

✅ Good: "97.8% automation rate with human oversight"  
❌ Avoid: "Pretty good automation most of the time"

✅ Good: "Month-end close status: Day 3 of 5, On Track"
❌ Avoid: "Close is going okay, almost done"
```

### **2. Action-Oriented**

**Principle:** Make next actions obvious with clear CTAs

**How to Apply:**
- Lead with action verbs
- Use task-focused language
- Provide clear next steps
- Focus on outcomes and results

**Examples:**
```
✅ Good: "Review 12 pending journal entries"
❌ Avoid: "There are some journal entries to look at"

✅ Good: "Complete reconciliation by EOD"
❌ Avoid: "Reconciliation needs to be done"

✅ Good: "Post Entry", "Approve Transaction", "Generate Report"
❌ Avoid: "Submit", "Click Here", "Go"
```

### **3. AI-Transparent**

**Principle:** Show what AI is doing, why, and confidence levels

**How to Apply:**
- Explain AI processes clearly
- Show confidence levels when relevant
- Make AI reasoning visible but not overwhelming  
- Use "How AI..." format for explanations

**Examples:**
```
✅ Good: "How AI Sequences Close Tasks & Manages Dependencies"
❌ Avoid: "AI handles close tasks automatically"

✅ Good: "Agent confidence: 94% (High)"
❌ Avoid: "AI is pretty sure about this"

✅ Good: "Powered by AI • 92% auto-match rate"
❌ Avoid: "AI magic inside!"
```

### **4. Information-Dense Organization** 

**Principle:** Controllers need lots of data, organize it clearly

**How to Apply:**
- Use progressive disclosure (summary → detail → transactions)
- Employ clear visual hierarchy
- Group related information logically
- Provide scanning-friendly layouts

**Examples:**
```
✅ Good: "5,200 journal entries • 350 reconciliations • 85 close tasks"
❌ Avoid: "Lots of financial data available"

✅ Good: "Status: 75% complete, Day 3 of 5, On Track ✓"
❌ Avoid: "Things are going well"
```
