# 📝 Instructions to Create New GitHub Repository

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. **Go to GitHub:**
   - Open your browser and go to: https://github.com/new
   - Or click the "+" icon in the top right → "New repository"

2. **Fill in the repository details:**
   - **Repository name:** `Data_AI_Finance360` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description:** "Custom Management Reporting Platform - Future of Finance"
   - **Visibility:** 
     - Choose **Public** (if you want others to see it)
     - Or **Private** (if you want it private)
   - **DO NOT** check:
     - ❌ "Add a README file" (we already have one)
     - ❌ "Add .gitignore" (we already have one)
     - ❌ "Choose a license" (we already have one)

3. **Click "Create repository"**

4. **Copy the repository URL** that GitHub shows you
   - It will look like: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Data_AI_Finance360.git`
   - Or: `git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/Data_AI_Finance360.git`

## Step 2: Come back here

After creating the repository, tell me:
- Your GitHub username
- The repository name you chose
- Or just the full repository URL

I'll then help you connect it and push your code!
